# **Company Profile**

Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada supports the Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector through initiatives that promote innovation and competitiveness [1].

# **Overview of Work Experience**

I have been given `two responsibilities` during my time working at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada:

## Production Control

- Involves moving, loading, sending, and receiving files containing information about agriculture/farmer's income and expenses from other departments or provinces in Canada, using MS Word, Excel, and Access.

## Programming

- Trained in JavaScript/JavaScript Vue to develop a website that accepts user inputted data and sends it to a database using Grails.
- Developed a Bridge app in MS Access using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that enables users to transfer data from one Excel file to another.

# **Application of Theory**

## **Analysis/Interpretation**

Website design: I `analyzed` the functions and purpose of `JavaScript/JavaScript Vue` by reviewing related documents.

Bridge app: I `analyzed the existing program`, focusing on the coding language (VBA) and understanding the functions and subroutines.

## **Project Design**

- Website design: I faced challenges in `designing the webpage format`, striving for an original design without referencing others' work. Although I achieved a simple design, it was `not effective` for handling large amounts of data.
- Bridge app: I modified the app's appearance, adding a progress bar and overall progress display to `improve` the user's understanding of the transfer process.

## **Testing/Verification**

- Website design: I experimented with existing functions, seeking verification from supervisors and gaining feedback on their purpose and workflow.
- Bridge app: I extensively tested specific functions/subroutines, sometimes spending a week due to the complexity of the code.

## **Implementation**

- Bridge app: After testing and optimizing the code, my supervisor encouraged exploring alternative ways to automate and optimize the app further.

# **Practical Experience**

## Studying existing engineering works:

Bridge app: I studied and analyzed the existing code, gaining an understanding of specific functions' importance.

## Applying designs as parts of larger systems:

Website design: I designed the code in modular parts to mitigate complexity and improve readability.

# **Engineering and Project Management**

## **Planning**

Programming: I created flowcharts to visualize my progress and direction using the Mermaid diagramming and charting tool.

## **Scheduling**

Production control: I followed a schedule to maximize the efficiency of file transfers with other departments/provinces.

# **Ethical Responsibilities**

## **Co-workers**

Production Control: I consistently emailed other departments or applicable provinces to inform them about file transfers, ensuring proper communication and coordination.

## **Employer/Supervisor**

My supervisor expected `daily/weekly reports` using a planning guide, schedule, and verbal/written updates. I included progress updates, plans for improvement, and any challenges or concerns, demonstrating responsibility and commitment.

# **Conclusion**

During my work term, I learned to accept `failures` and `criticism`, enhancing my growth. Seeking help and receiving feedback allowed me to improve my work. Patience became crucial as I spent a significant amount of time coding and exploring new ideas/technologies.

The Computer Science courses `COMP 1012 (Computer Programming for Scientists and Engineers)` and `COMP 1020 (Introductory Computer Science 2)` were invaluable as they provided the foundation for understanding new languages like JavaScript/Vue and Visual Basic for Applications. `COMP 2140 (Data Structures and Algorithms)` would have been beneficial for further Java experience, data structures, and language comprehension.

During this time at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, as a third-year computer science student, I had the opportunity to explore both software and hardware engineering fields. This work term provided valuable insights into the software engineering field, giving me a glimpse into the daily life of a software engineer.
